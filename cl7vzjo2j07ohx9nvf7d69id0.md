# How Edo Guida got a Python job in three months with no programming background

## Skilled Python Professionals' Demand

Take a look at [this article](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/insights/python-insights) to understand why Python is the programming language of the present and the future.

Okay, you've already got a reason to learn Python: you will have more chances because Python-related job offers will grow more and more over the coming years.

As the previous article states, you may end up in a job earning 65k a year; you may not worry so much about money when making decisions as you move forward in life!

> IT Jobs Watch, a website that specialises in collating salary data across the IT industry, states that the median annual salary in the UK for a role requiring Python skills is £65,000.

Before getting there, keep your feet on Earth because you need to master Python.

## Get a Job to Learn Python

Don't think you need a Computer Science degree or a Data Science master's to master Python before getting the job.

The best motivation to learn anything is that they pay you for it. Therefore, it would help to prioritise getting a job where you increase your Python skills.

Companies care about getting shit done. Therefore, you must show them what you know about programming and how you program.

1. Complete online courses to [show what you know with certificates](https://opencourser.com/post/i2b6ff/how-to-find-your-udemy-certificate-and-add-it-to-linkedin)

    1. Solve their assignments

    2. Get your data and experiment with the learnt concepts

2. Showcase your knowledge on GitHub to show how you program (you may look at [Edo's profile](https://github.com/edoardo1097) to see his portfolio)

He followed our advice and got a job in two months. He applied to around a hundred job offers on LinkedIn where recruiters could see [his certifications](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edoardo-guida-9b0537171/).

## Where to start

Make it easy at the beginning with easy-to-understand Python code.

Some people use scripts to code. It'd help if you turned to the notebook format because you could see the output of every line right away. Follow [this tutorial to install Jupyter Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hGqSFqu_nek), the best program to work with notebooks and write your Python's first lines of code.

I have found Data Visualization to be the best starting topic because you immediately see how the output changes as you change the code. It gives you a massive dope of energy.

Follow [this Data Visualization tutorial](https://blog.resolvingpython.com/04-data-visualization-in-python) to get a complete overview of Data Visualization development in Python. Then, play around with the lines of code: add more data points to the plots or change the colour of the figures.

Once you are motivated and comfortable using Python, it is time to follow a proper learning path.

## Roadmap

You can follow any roadmaps, but please make sure you don't overestimate your skills and start developing Neural Networks if you don't know how to create a simple Linear Regression.

You can follow Edo's roadmap by looking at his certifications:
