# You Need to Have Flexible Thinking when Programming

If you are trying to solve a problem with programming, you may have several solutions to get the same result.

A basic idea that we don't get at the beginning because we look for that perfect solution.

It doesnâ€™t exist.

It would be best to start thinking about choosing the "one" option, not "the" option.

Letâ€™s say that we are facing the following problem: visualise two variables with a scatterplot.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/tips.csv')
df.head()
```

In Python, youâ€™ve got 3 libraries that can make a `scatterplot`:

1. `matplotlib`
2. `seaborn`
3. `plotly`

Letâ€™s observe the differences:

## Matplotlib

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=df)
```

## Seaborn

```python
import seaborn as sns

sns.scatterplot(x='total_bill', y='tip', data=df)
```

## Plotly

```python
import plotly.express as px

px.scatter(data_frame=df, x='total_bill', y='tip')
```

# Takeaways

1. `matplotlib` allows you to create custom plots, but you need to write more code.
2. `seaborn` automates the plot so that you donâ€™t need to write more lines. For example, `seaborn` added the x & y axis labels by default. `matplotlib` didnâ€™t.
3. `plotly` allows you to interact with the plot. Give it a try and hover the mouse over the points.

If you are to make a plot for an online post, you may like to use `plotly` due to its interactivity. Nevertheless, you wouldnâ€™t use it if you were writing a paper article.
